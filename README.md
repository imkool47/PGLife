# PGLife
This is a full-stack web application I developed during my Internshala web development training. It features both frontend and backend components designed to help students find accommodation.

# Purpose of the App
The app is designed to address the challenges students face when searching for accommodation, allowing them to easily find suitable properties.

# App Overview

This web app comes with several exciting features, showcased below. Due to database integration, hosting on GitHub is not possible. However, I will provide a link to a demo video. You can download the source code and run it locally using XAMPP.

### Technologies Used
